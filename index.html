      <p>
        The reason why Splatoon 3 is my all-time favourite video game is because
        it's extremely fun to play, the character designs are well made, as well
        as their personalities. The character customization and the splatfests,
        which happen once a month, are really fun, and the splatfests even get
        extremely competitive.

        There's a full on wikipedia for everything in the Splatoon franchise.

        Even though it released less than 6 months ago, it is one of the best
        Legend of Zelda games that was ever made. Being the sequel to Breath of
        the Wild, the creators behind the game made the sequel to it ten
        thousand times better than Breath of the Wild. The gameplay is
        phenominal. The abilities are really good, allow you to improvise for
        anything, even for some of the puzzles in the game, like the shrines.
        They make the game easier, and more fun to play. I've spent over 30
        hours playing this game over the first month of it being released.

        This game takes me way back to my younger days. My dad would play this
        game and I would watch it since I was little. Yes, I know it's rated
        Mature 17+, but I enjoyed the game so much and didn't mind the stuff in
        the game that made it rated for people 17+. The open world, the
        professions, skills, everything makes it really good for a game released
        in 2011. Best of all, it's easily moddable, so you can make the game how
        you want it to be played. From permadeath to more in-game items, the
        possibilites are basically endless. If someone asked me if they should
        get the game, I would say yes with no hesitation.

        Such a timeless classic. I remember being in elementary, watching
        Minecraft Mod Reviews after coming home from school. This game is so
        simple, yet fun to play. Survival, Creative, Multiplayer, (I know you
        can play both survival and creative in multiplayer) but still extremely
        fun. Although I suck at a lot of things in Minecraft, I still think it's
        one of the best simple games ever made.

        Samurai Warriors Series (Samurai Warriors 1-5, Spirit of
        Sanada/Sanadamaru)

          I played the third game when I was around in the first grade. Samurai
          Warriors 3 on the Nintendo Wii was my first Samurai Warriors game I've
          ever played, and I still enjoy playing it. The characters, and the
          gameplay is great for a game released in 2008. This game series was
          even how I got into learning about the Sengoku Period in Japan.
          Nobunaga Oda is still one of my favourite characters in the game.
          Titled the "Demon King", and wielding a demonic katana really got me
          interested when I first played. Although in Samurai Warriors 5, where
          all the movesets got changed, Nobunaga, the main character in the 5th
          game's story, still interested me, even though the 5th game didn't get
          as much good reviews, since it was rushed. I still enjoy both the 3rd
          game and the 5th game, even though they recieved the least amount of
          feedback out of all of the other ones. This franchise always has a
          place in my heart.

        Combining the worlds of Samurai Warriors in Sengoku Japan, (Characters
        from Samurai Warriors 3, and the cut characters from Samurai Warriors 1
        and 2) and Dynasty Warriors in Three Kingdoms China, (Characters from
        Dynasty Warriors 7) while mixing in a few bonus characters, like Orochi,
        Orochi X, Gyuki, Diamondback, Dodomeki, Da Ji, Sun Wukong, Kiyomori
        Taira, Himiko, Kyubi/Tamamo, Susano'o, Mystics like Kaguya and Taigong
        Wang, (even though there's many more) Semei Abe, and many other
        characters in Koei's (the people who made the Warriors Games) other
        games, too. Not only that, two extra historical characters come into
        play, as well. Joan of Arc and Achilles are in this game, as well. This
        game has the best storyline in the Warriors Orochi series, in my
        opinion. With over 150 characters to play, with extremely fun gameplay,
        fun storyline, and just a really fun game.

      <li>Totally Accurate Battle Simulator</li>
      <img src="img/tabslogo.png" alt="TABS logo" width="500" />

      <p>
        This game is both fun and really stupid. It is a battle simulator, but
        the "Totally Accurate" part is debatable. You could pit cavemen against
        Ancient Greece, or Samurai against 5 wooly mammoths. There's multiple
        factions, a unit creator, faction creator, map creator, and a campaign
        creator. The gameplay is really ridiculous, but hilarious at the same
        time. Your units could be randomized in size, looks, (like being a
        cyclops, having two eyes, or having the same amount of eyes as a spider,
        having a big or small head, and a whole bunch of other characteristics.)
        The ridiculous parts is where your units could trip over a blade of
        grass and fall into a coma, wield their weapons weirdly, and many
        ridiculous other things. The game's also really cheap, too. It's around
        like $23, and I would highly recommend that you get it.

        My favourite movie series of all time. The original released in 1985,
        and it focuses on two characters: Marty McFly, and Doc Brown. Doc Brown
        invents a time machine out of a DeLorean car. It requires 1.28 gigawatts
        to power the flux capacator, which makes time travel possible. Not only
        that, you also gotta travel at 88 mph in order to travel through time.
        The plots in all three of those movies are amazing. In the first movie,
        Marty travels to 1955 to save Doc Brown after he gets killed in 1985,
        and Marty meets his parents, but younger. In the second movie, Marty and
        Doc Brown travels to 2015 to make sure Marty's and Jennifer's kids don't
        get into jail, but then an alternate timeline happens when George
        McFly's bully, Biff Tannen uses something from the future to get himself
        rich and marrying Marty's mother. Marty fixes the timeline, but Doc
        Brown's time machine gets struck by lightning and travels to 1885. Marty
        wants to go back to 1885 to save Doc Brown, even though the letter sent
        to Marty written by Doc told him explicitly to go back to 1985, as he's
        happy with his life in 1885. This movie series has both comedy and
        really great action sequences, as well.

        I love Star Wars. I know my opinion may be a little controversial in the
        community, but I believe that even the sequels (Epsiodes 7-9) are still
        good movies. In fact, I love all of the episodes equally. Yes, I know
        some has flaws, like Episode 2 mainly focusing on Anakin's and Padme's
        secret relationship, and the sequels having a different director, unlike
        episodes 1-6. Both Kylo Ren and Darth Vader are my two favourite Sith
        characters, and Obi-Wan, Anakin, Luke Skywalker, and Yoda and Ahsoka
        Tano are my favourite Jedi characters. (Yes, I know Anakin and Darth
        Vader are the same people)

        It's no surprise that gaming is on here, since the favourite video game
        list is higher than any of the other lists on this page. I loved gaming,
        ever since I got introduced to the Nintendo Wii, and played Wii Sports
        and Skylanders during the weekends. Whenever I got a good grade on
        something, my dad would take me shopping to get one or two skylanders.

        It's one of my favourite things to do during my spare time. I have this
        one series that I'm writing for fun, called Keys to the Multiverse. It's
        a universe where many universes collide. Mainly the Splatoon Universe
        and the Spider-Man universe, but some more, like the Arcane Odyssey
        universe, and the Forsaken Sword Legacies universe as well. Sadly, I am
        running out of spare time to write this, and I still hope I can continue
        writing the series.

        I love singing, and humming video game music, or just any music that
        doesn't have any lyrics. I wanna be a singer some day, and I hope that
        it would work. I hate that my singing voice is usually monotone, because
        when I try to sing a high note, my voice cracks or gets squeaky. I don't
        really sing in school, or something, unless someone asks me to sing. If
        my parents do, I don't.

        Thanks to Dance Dance Revolution, it has inspired me to dance even more.
        But still, I dance in private when I get the chance to. I don't do it a
        lot in other places, because other people would be seeing and I get
        nervous when people look at what I'm doing for some things. It just adds
        so much pressure, and it feels like I have to fit people's expectations.
